# Interactive-Rating-Component


- Practised some basic HTML, CSS, boostrap and javascript!

- I am a beginner and I cannot get the Javascript file to work:

1. I am trying to select the anchor tag with a particular class and change its href so I am redirected to the HTML file which returns the correct rating. How do I do this?

2. Does the visual layout using html css and bootstrap look ok?
